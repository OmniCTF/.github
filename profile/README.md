> **OmniCTF** is a competition-first initiative. We run on-site and online CTF events, publish schedules, rules, results, and media kits, maybe even challenges.

## 🎯 Mission

Train and spotlight the next wave of defenders and breakers through **fair, well‑run competitions** that feel close to real incidents, minus the collateral. Learn fast, compete hard, respect the rules.

**Operate → Detect → Exploit → Report.**
**Hack everything (in-scope). Break nothing (out-of-scope).**

## ❓ FAQ

**Q: Why keep challenges private?**  
A: We reuse and evolve content. Public source would dilute fairness and future event quality.

**Q: Can I practice on past challenges?**  
A: We occasionally release **sanitized** replicas or demos after a deprecation window. Watch this space, but assume **no public drop** by default.

**Q: Can I use AI during the event?**  
A: Yes—for research and brainstorming. You must not paste or share live challenge content publicly during the event.
